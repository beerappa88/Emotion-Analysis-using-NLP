# Emotion-Analysis-using-NLP
**Project: Emotion Classification using NLP**

- **Data Preprocessing:**
  - Handled a dataset of 260,000 bytes, preprocessing 1.6 million text samples.
  - Used Pandas and NumPy for efficient data manipulation.
  - Addressed null values and formatted data for model compatibility.

- **Visualization:**
  - Employed Matplotlib and Seaborn for insightful data visualization.
  - Created count and violin plots to showcase emotion distribution.

- **Machine Learning Model:**
  - Developed an NLP-based model for emotion classification.
  - Overcame challenges like encoding sentiments and handling categorical data.

- **Outcome:**
  - Successfully trained and evaluated the model, understanding data biases.
  - Contributed to a robust emotion classification model.
